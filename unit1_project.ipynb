    "##This code is case sensitive in the sense that it doesn't recognize that capital letters are equal to lowercase letters, so it doesn't count them as consecutive repetitions of the same character. In order to fix that, I would have to put somewhere in the function (probably best outside the for loop), that upper case letters of the alphabet are equal to lower case letters of the alphabet one for one. I'd probably make a list with all the lower case letters, and a list of all the uppercase letters, and say something like for i in range(len(lowercase)): for x in range(len(upercase)): lowercase[i] = uppercase[x]"

    "This one was one of the most complicated. I knew from the offset that I would have to have a count variable that would increase every time there was a consecutive repetition of a character within a string. I knew it would have to be a function that would return a string. I knew the function would have to say at the end that the compressed string should only be printed if it was smaller in lenght than the actual string. I knew that I would have to have if statements determining how the count was going to be changed, and specifing what was going to go into the compressed string. And I knew that I was going to have to set the count back to its original value at the end of the forloop. The hard part was fixing everything that was going wrong with the code. The syntax, the logic. There were a lot of moving parts that were difficult to keep organized. "

    "This one was fairly straightforward. I got a range of every natural number up to 100 and checked  each number in a for loop to see if it fit anyone of the three parameters. If the number was divisible by three and five it would be replaced with \"Fizbuzz\", if it was divisible by only three it would pring Fizz, and if it was divisible by five it would print Buzz. If it wasn't divisible by three or five it would just print the number. I put the if statements within the for loop in that order to make sure that it would print the right string for numbers that were divisible by both three and five. If I didn't put 3 and five as the first condition, the loop would not get to that if statement, and wouldn't print the right strings for those numbers, it would print the strings for multiples of three of the strings for multiples of five.
